    ❗ This SQL query is vulnerable to injection. Use parameterized queries:
    ```sql
    -- Instead of:
    $"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {userId}"

    -- Use:
    "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = @userId"
    ```

    💡 Consider extracting this into a separate function for reusability:
    ```javascript
    function validateEmail(email) {
      return /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/.test(email);
    }
    ```

    👍 Great job handling the edge case here! The null check prevents
    potential runtime errors.
