# Framework Selection - Choose based on project needs
# Reference: ISTQB Glossary v4.0, Martin Fowler's Testing Pyramid
framework_options:
  decision_point: Select testing framework based on project type
  choices:
    - id: istqb-framework
      file: options/testing/istqb-framework.ai.yaml
      best_for: Enterprise projects, certification needs, formal QA processes
    - id: industry-pyramid
      file: options/testing/industry-pyramid.ai.yaml
      best_for: Agile development, CI/CD optimization, rapid iteration

# Default pyramid (Industry standard - can be overridden by framework choice)
pyramid:
  ratio: "70/20/10"
  note: "Industry standard ratio. ISTQB framework uses 4 levels without fixed ratios."
  levels:
    - name: Unit Tests (UT)
      percentage: 70
      scope: Single function/method
      speed: Very fast (<100ms)
    - name: Integration Tests (IT/SIT)
      percentage: 20
      scope: Multiple components
      speed: Fast (<1s)
      note: "IT (Agile/DevOps) or SIT (Enterprise/ISTQB) - both refer to integration testing"
    - name: E2E Tests
      percentage: 10
      scope: User flows / System testing
      speed: Slow (>10s)

rules:
  - id: follow-pyramid
    trigger: planning test strategy
    instruction: Follow 70/20/7/3 ratio for UT/IT/ST/E2E
    priority: required

  - id: first-principles
    trigger: writing tests
    instruction: Follow FIRST principles (Fast, Independent, Repeatable, Self-validating, Timely)
    priority: required

  - id: arrange-act-assert
    trigger: structuring test
    instruction: Use Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
    priority: required

  - id: meaningful-names
    trigger: naming tests
    instruction: Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
    priority: required
    examples:
      good:
        - "should_return_user_when_valid_id_provided"
        - "test_login_fails_with_invalid_credentials"
      bad:
